### File-Services

SSfSBT provides a variety of file services that can read from and write to various files used in bioinformatics.
They are located in the file_services folder. Each file service is a class providing class methods.<br> 
Their read()-methods are generators, yielding dictionaries.<br>
Their write()-methods accept iterables of dictionaries.

| File type     | Can read | Can write | Additional info |
|---------------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| FASTA         | ✅       | ✅       | Sequences
| FASTQ         | ✅       | ✅       | Sequences
| PAF           | ✅       | ✅       | Pairwise sequence alignments from [Minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2)
| SAM           | ✅       | ✅       | Pairwise sequence alignments from basically any other alignment tool
| BCALM (FASTA) | ✅       | ❌       | De Bruijn Graph from BCALM
| FASTG (FASTA) | ✅       | ❌       | De Bruijn Graph from SPAdes
